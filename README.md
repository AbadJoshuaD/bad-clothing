## This was the main project from the Complete React Developer a full e-commerce website. 

I made this my first attempt learning the react eco system and stop on the redux part and remake try to remake the project on my own. You can find the original project on my repo https://github.com/AbadJoshuaD/crwn-clothing.  


Here the things I have learned from doing my first attempt on this project.
* React Router
  - Wrapping your main application using Browser Router to have access on the API of react router known as the three main props.
    * Match - contains a params of url matches
    * History - contains a push method that allows you to have a more control routing. Ex. onClick ={()=> {history.push('/checkout')
    * Location - contains your current url path
  - Route - I have learned three attributes of this router component such as.
    * exact - receives true/false
    * component - receives component to render
    * render - receives more of a functional approach it depends on the user what to render within this attribute
  - Switch - Based on my understanding allows you to only render the first route so that if you have make misconfig on your routing it will not bet rendered on the same pages.
  - Link - As what it components states it is a link that has an attribute *to* that accepts the url path you need. It will give you an anchor tag.
* React Forms
* Basic setup of firebase authentication and database. Setting up an google sign in authenthication for user.
